# Operators and Loops
 

## There are Tow Types of Operators : Comparison Operators and Logical Operators

## Comparison operators :
### Comparison operators allow you to compare two values. it used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values .


| Operator                               | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| equal to                               | ==                                                                 |
| equal value and equal type             | ===                                                                |
| not equal                              | !=                                                                 |
| not equal value or not equal type      | !=                                                                 |
| greater than                           | >                                                                  |
| less than                              | <                                                                  |
| greater than or equal to               | >=                                                                 |
| less than or equal to                  | <=                                                                 |



## Logical Operators
### Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.


#### && (and)

#### || (or)

#### ! (not)


## Loop

### I loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.

- for loop: is a loop that runs for a preset number of times.
- while loop is a loop that is repeated as long as an expression is true.
- do while loop or repeat until loop repeats until an expression becomes false.

### loop life cycle:
- initialization
- check condition
- update Initial value
