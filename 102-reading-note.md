### The mindset is like a muscle, develops with practice. For people who learn new things constantly, their mindset develops and becomes better , . And they become better at learning and faster in performing tasks .

### There are two types of mindsets: growth mindset and ~~fixed mindset~~ , The fixed mentality does not recognize development and adopts the theory of the innate talent that is born with a person and cannot be acquired. We have a mentality of growth adopts the theory of development, as intelligence and talent can develop with practice and hard work.

*Things that I personally think develop a growth mindset:*
 1. **Practice** : Training and practice gradually develops a person's mentality and makes them faster and better at performing tasks.
 2. **Non-surrender**: One of the most prominent features of a fixed mindset is surrender at the first obstacle. To develop your growth mindset, you must challenge the problems you face and try to solve them several times.
 3. **Positive words**: Positive words have a magical effect on your mind. Words such as: I can succeed- I will not give up pushes you to work hard continuously.
